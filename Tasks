Tasks Done: 
a. Split the data into X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test
b. Data Visualisation and preprocessing
c.  Visualize the first 10 images in train data and print their corresponding labels
d. Reshape all the images with appropriate shapes and update the data in the same variable.
e. Normalise the images i.e. Normalise the pixel values.
f. Transform Labels into a format acceptable by Neural Network
g. Print the total Number of classes in the Dataset
h. Model Training & Evaluation using Neural Network(CNN)
i. Plot the training loss, validation loss vs number of epochs and training accuracy,
validation accuracy vs number of epochs plot and write your observations on the same.
j. Train the classifier using previously designed Architecture
k.  summarize the history of the model
